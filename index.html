					<h3>Hampta Pass</h3>
					<p>Hampta Pass is one of the most dramatic crossover treks you can do. Right from the beginning of this trek, the trail sets the tone for the heightened drama on its terrain. This begins with your first campsite, Jobra, which is at the edge of the forest. Your next campsite Jwara is a wildflower meadow at the meeting point of a valley! We have the pass crossing, which is a cherry on top of the cake. This trail climbs to the pass out of lush green valleys of Kullu to a perpendicular overhang, high in the mountains. From the pass, you see the Lahaul valley and surrounding mountains in one wide panoramic sweep. This is one of the most incredible twists in landscapes you will see! However, the incredibly dramatic landscapes on this trek have to be earned!</p>
